OTHER HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND AREAS

Heavy Rainfall Outlook
Refer to Weather Advisory No. 1 issued at 11:00 PM today for the Heavy Rainfall Outlook associated with Severe Tropical Storm MARCE.

Severe Winds
• The wind signals warn the public of the general wind threat over an area due to the tropical cyclone. Local winds may be slightly stronger/enhanced in coastal and upland/mountainous areas exposed to winds. Winds are less strong in areas sheltered from the prevailing wind direction.
• Minimal to minor impacts from strong winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 1.
The highest Wind Signal which may be hoisted during the occurrence of MARCE is Wind Signal No. 4.

Furthermore, northeasterly wind flow will also bring strong to gale-force gusts over the following areas (especially in coastal and upland areas exposed to winds):
• Tomorrow (5 November): Ilocos Sur, Aurora, Quezon, and Camarines Norte.
• Wednesday (6 November): Ilocos Region, Quezon, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, and Catanduanes.
• Thursday (7 November): Ilocos Region

HAZARDS AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS

24-Hour Sea Condition Outlook
Up to rough seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 3.5 m: The seaboard of Batanes.
• Up to 3.0 m: The seaboards Babuyan Islands, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Isabela, northern Aurora; the eastern seaboard on mainland Cagayan.
• Mariners of small seacrafts, including all types of motorbancas, are advised not to venture out to sea under these conditions, especially if inexperienced or operating ill-equipped vessels.

Up to moderate seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 2.5 m: The remaining seaboards of mainland Cagayan and Aurora; the northern and eastern seaboards of Polillo Islands.
• Up to 2.0 m: The remaining seaboards of Ilocos Region; the seaboards of northern Quezon and Camarines Norte; the northern and eastern seaboards of Catanduanes and Northern Samar; the eastern seaboards of Albay, Sorsogon, and Eastern Samar. 
• Mariners of motorbancas and similarly-sized vessels are advised to take precautionary measures while venturing out to sea and, if possible, avoid navigation under these conditions.

TRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK

• MARCE is forecast to move generally west northwestward today until tomorrow (5 November) before turning westward at a slow pace over the Philippine Sea east of Extreme Northern Luzon. On the forecast track, MARCE will make landfall in the vicinity of Babuyan Islands or mainland northern Cagayan on Thursday evening (7 November) or Friday (8 November) early morning. Due to uncertainty in the strength of the high pressure area north of MARCE, the forecast track may still change and bring the landfall point to mainland Cagayan-Isabela area.
• This tropical cyclone is expected to gradually intensify and may reach severe tropical storm category tonight or tomorrow (5 November) morning. Furthermore, it may also reach typhoon category by tomorrow evening or Wednesday early morning. Rapid intensification is likely.

Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all necessary measures to protect life and property.

TRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK
• MARCE is forecast to move generally west northwestward slowly today (6 November) over the waters east of Cagayan before gradually accelerating westward tomorrow (7 November) through Saturday (9 November) over the Babuyan Channel and the northern portion of the West Philippine Sea. On the forecast track, MARCE will make landfall and traverse Babuyan Islands and/or the northern portions of mainland Cagayan, Ilocos Norte, and Apayao (or pass very close to these areas) from tomorrow afternoon to Friday (8 November) early morning. MARCE may exit the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) region on Friday evening. The surge of the northeasterly wind flow will result a more southwestward movement during the weekend.
• MARCE is expected to continue intensifying and may reach its peak intensity today before its passage over the Babuyan Channel. Slight weakening is expected due to possible interaction with the terrain of mainland Luzon, although MARCE will remain as a typhoon throughout its passage within the PAR region. The surge of the northeasterly wind flow will trigger a continuous period of weakening during the weekend.

Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. For heavy rainfall warnings, thunderstorm/rainfall advisories, and other severe weather information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your local PAGASA Regional Services Division.

The shift of wind direction from northeasterly to easterly due to the establishment of the High Pressure Area (HPA) over the Northwestern Pacific signifies the termination of the Northeast Monsoon over most parts of the country and the start of the dry season. However, the extreme Northern Luzon may still experience occasional northeasterly winds. With this development, the day-to-day weather across the country will gradually become warmer, though isolated thunderstorms are also likely to occur.

The public is advised to take precautionary measures to minimize heat stress and optimize the daily use of water for personal and domestic consumption.

Tropical Depression 
Issued at 11:00 PM, 20 October 2024
Valid for broadcast until the next bulletin at 11:00 AM tomorrow.

THE LOW PRESSURE AREA OUTSIDE THE PHILIPPINE AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY DEVELOPED INTO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION

Location of Center (10:00 PM): The center of Tropical Depression was estimated based on all available at 1,255 km East of Southeastern Luzon (14.4°N, 135.8°E)

Intensity: Maximum sustained winds of 55 km/h near the center, gustiness of up to 70 km/h, and central pressure of 1002 hPa

Present Movement: Westward at 30 km/h

Extent of Tropical Cyclone Winds: Strong winds extend outwards up to 700 km from the center

GENERAL OUTLOOK FOR THE FORECAST PERIOD
Refer to Weather Advisory No. 1 issued at 11:00 PM today for the heavy rainfall outlook due to the Trough of Tropical Cyclone outside PAR.

24-Hour Sea Condition Outlook
• Moderate to rough seas over the following coastal waters: 
• Up to 3.5 m: The seaboards of Batanes, Babuyan Islands, Isabela, and the eastern seaboard of Cagayan
• Up to 2.5 m: The seaboards of Ilocos Norte and Aurora, the remaining seaboard of Cagayan, the eastern seaboards of Quezon and Bicol Region, and the southern seaboard of Davao Region.
• Mariners of small seacrafts, including all types of motorbancas, are advised not to venture out to sea under these conditions, especially if inexperienced or operating ill-equipped vessels.
• Up to moderate seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 2.0 m: The remaining seaboards of the country.
• Mariners of motorbancas and similarly-sized vessels are advised to take precautionary measures while venturing out to sea and, if possible, avoid navigation under these conditions.

Track and Intensity Outlook
• The tropical depression is forecast to enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) tomorrow (21 October) early morning, and is expected to move westward until Tuesday (22 October) morning before turning west northwestward to northwestward from Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday (23 October) evening. Afterwards, this weather disturbance will then turn west northwestward and is forecast to make landfall over the northeastern portion of Cagayan by Friday (25 October) evening.
• This tropical cyclone is forecast to intensify into a tropical storm in the next 12 hours. It may reach severe tropical storm category by Tuesday afternoon or evening and typhoon category by Thursday (24 October) afternoon or evening, prior to landfall over the northeastern portion of Cagayan.
• Upon entry in PAR region, this tropical cyclone will be given the local name of “KRISTINE”.
• Since this tropical cyclone is still over the Philippine Sea, further intensification is likely, given the favorable environmental conditions (high SST and low wind shear) for development over the area. Changes in forecast track is also not ruled out, depending on the movement of the weather systems over the mid-latitude over the next days.

Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to continue monitoring for updates related to this tropical cyclone. 

Unless there is an intermediate issuance, the next tropical cyclone advisory will be issued at 11:00 AM tomorrow.

Severe Winds
The wind signals warn the public of the general wind threat over an area due to the tropical cyclone. Local winds may be slightly stronger/enhanced in coastal and upland/mountainous areas exposed to winds. Winds are less strong in areas sheltered from the prevailing wind direction.

• Minor to moderate impacts from gale-force winds are possible within any of the localities where Wind Signal No. 2 is hoisted.
• Minimal to minor impacts from strong winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 1.

The highest Wind Signal which may be hoisted during the occurrence of KRISTINE is Wind Signal No. 3.

Furthermore, the wind flow coming towards the circulation of KRISTINE and the Northeasterly Windflow will also bring strong to gale-force gusts over the following areas (especially in coastal and upland areas exposed to winds):

• Today (23 October): MIMAROPA, Visayas, and Mindanao.
• Tomorrow (24 October): MIMAROPA, Bicol Region, Visayas, Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Zamboanga del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Northern Mindanao, Dinagat Islands, Surigao del Norte, Davao del Sur, and Davao Oriental.
• Friday (25 October): MIMAROPA, Bicol Region, Western Visayas, Negros Occidental, Zamboanga del Norte, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi.

Coastal Inundation
There is a moderate to significant risk of life-threatening storm surge in the next 48 hours over the low-lying or exposed coastal localities of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union, Pangasinan, Cagayan, Isabela, Zambales, Aurora, Camarines Sur, and Catanduanes. For more information, refer to Storm Surge Warning No. 5 issued at 8:00 AM today.

HAZARDS AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS
A Gale Warning is hoisted over the seaboards of Luzon and Visayas. For more information, refer to Gale Warning No. 5 issued at 5:00 AM today.

• Up to moderate seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 2.5 m: The remaining seaboards of Mindanao.
• Mariners of motorbancas and similarly-sized vessels are advised to take precautionary measures while venturing out to sea and, if possible, avoid navigation under these conditions.

TRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK
• KRISTINE is forecast to move generally northwestward for the next 12 hours before turning generally westward for the rest of the forecast period. It is forecast to make landfall over Isabela or northern Aurora tonight or tomorrow (24 October) early morning. It will then cross the mountainous terrain of Northern Luzon and emerge over the waters west of Ilocos Region tomorrow afternoon. KRISTINE may exit the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) region on Friday (25 October). 
• KRISTINE is forecast to gradually intensify into a severe tropical storm before making landfall. Slight weakening will occur while crossing Northern Luzon. Re-intensification may occur over the West Philippine Sea.

Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials.

OTHER HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND AREAS
Heavy Rainfall Outlook
Refer to Weather Advisory No. 55 issued at 11:00 PM today for the heavy rainfall outlook associated with “PEPITO”.
Severe Winds
The wind signals warn the public of the general wind threat over an area due to the tropical cyclone. Local winds may be slightly stronger/enhanced in coastal and upland/mountainous areas exposed to winds. Winds are less strong in areas sheltered from the prevailing wind direction.
• Significant to severe impacts from typhoon-force winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 4.
• Moderate to significant impacts from storm-force winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 3.
• Minor to moderate impacts from gale-force winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 2.
• Minimal to minor impacts from strong winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 1.
Coastal Inundation
There is a high risk of life-threatening storm surge with peak surge heights exceeding 3.0 m in the next 48 hours over the low-lying or exposed coastal localities of Ilocos Region, southeastern mainland Cagayan, Isabela, Central Luzon, Metro Manila, Cavite, Quezon (eastern coast) including Polillo Islands, and Camarines Norte. Refer to Storm Surge Warning No. 12 issued at 8:00 PM today for the details.
HAZARDS AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS
A Gale Warning is hoisted over the eastern seaboard of Luzon and the western seaboards of Northern and Central Luzon. Refer to Gale Warning No. 15 issued at 5:00 PM today for the details.
24-Hour Sea Condition Outlook
Note: These are forecast sea condition over the coastal waters and not related to storm surge heights or inundation.
Up to very rough or high seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 7.0 m: The seaboards of Aurora and Isabela
• Up to 5.5 m: The eastern seaboard of mainland Cagayan; the seaboards of Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur
• Up to 5.0 m: The seaboard of northern mainland Quezon; the northern and eastern seaboards of Polillo Islands
• Up to 4.5 m: The seaboards of La Union and Pangasinan
• Sea travel is risky for all types or tonnage of vessels. All mariners must remain in port or, if underway, seek shelter or safe harbor as soon as possible until winds and waves subside. 
Up to rough seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 4.0 m: The seaboard of Babuyan Islands; the remaining seaboard of mainland Cagayan
• Up to 3.5 m: The northern seaboard of Camarines Norte; the seaboard of Batanes
• Up to 3.0 m: The western seaboard of Zambales; the northern and eastern seaboards of Catanduanes; the northern seaboard of Camarines Sur.
• Mariners of small seacrafts, including all types of motorbancas, are advised not to venture out to sea under these conditions, especially if inexperienced or operating ill-equipped vessels.
Up to moderate seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 2.5 m: The eastern seaboard of Quezon including the rest of Polillo Islands; the remaining seaboards of Catanduanes; the northern and eastern seaboards of Northern Samar; the eastern seaboard of Albay; the western seaboard of Bataan.
• Up to 2.0 m: The western seaboard of Lubang Islands, Batangas, and Occidental Mindoro; the eastern seaboards of Camarines Sur, Sorsogon, Eastern Samar and Dinagat Islands; the northern and western seaboard of Calamian Islands
• Mariners of motorbancas and similarly-sized vessels are advised to take precautionary measures while venturing out to sea and, if possible, avoid navigation under these conditions.
TRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK
• Typhoon PEPITO has now exited the landmass of Luzon but is still near the coast of La Union and Pangasinan.
• Over the West Philippine Sea, PEPITO will continue moving generally west northwestward tomorrow. It may exit the PAR region tomorrow morning or noon. Outside the PAR region, the tropical cyclone will turn more westward or west southwestward on Tuesday (19 November) under the influence of an incoming northeasterly wind surge. Further weakening will also occur as PEPITO moves over the West Philippine Sea due to the same surge creating unfavorable environment.
• It must be emphasized that heavy rainfall, severe winds, and storm surge may still be experienced in localities outside the landfall point and the forecast confidence cone. Refer to “Other Hazards affecting Land Areas” for more details.  Furthermore, the track may still shift within the limit of the forecast confidence cone.
Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. For heavy rainfall warnings, thunderstorm/rainfall advisories, and other severe weather information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your local PAGASA Regional Services Division.
The next tropical cyclone bulletin will be issued at 2:00 AM tomorrow.

TROPICAL CYCLONE WIND SIGNALS (TCWS) IN EFFECT
No Wind Signal currently hoisted.
OTHER HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND AREAS
Heavy Rainfall Outlook
As MARCE moves northwestward within the PAR region, it may enhance the surge of northeasterly wind flow which may occur within the week. This, and the trough of the tropical cyclone, will bring rains over Extreme Northern Luzon and the eastern section of Luzon beginning tomorrow or on Tuesday. A Weather Advisory may be issued over the next days as MARCE moves closer towards Northern Luzon.
Severe Winds
Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal No. 1 may be hoisted over portions of Cagayan by tomorrow. The highest Wind Signal which may be hoisted during the occurrence of LEON is Wind Signal No. 4.
Furthermore, northeasterly wind flow will also bring strong to gale-force gusts over the following areas (especially in coastal and upland areas exposed to winds):
• Today (4 November): Batanes, Cagayan including Babuyan Islands, Isabela, Ilocos Norte, Aurora, and the northern portion of Quezon.
• Tomorrow (5 November): Batanes, Cagayan including Babuyan Islands, Isabela, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Aurora, Quezon, and Camarines Norte.
• Tuesday (6 November): Ilocos Region, Quezon, Camarines Norte, Camarines Sur, and Catanduanes.
HAZARDS AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS
24-Hour Sea Condition Outlook
Up to rough seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 3.0 m: The seaboards of Batanes and Ilocos Norte.
• Mariners of small seacrafts, including all types of motorbancas, are advised not to venture out to sea under these conditions, especially if inexperienced or operating ill-equipped vessels.
Up to moderate seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 2.5 m: The seaboards of Babuyan Islands; the eastern seaboard of mainland Cagayan and Isabela.
• Up to 2.0 m: The remaining seaboard of Ilocos Region; the seaboards of Kalayaan Islands; the seaboard of Aurora and Camarines Norte; the northern and eastern seaboard of northern Quezon including Polillo Islands, Catanduanes, Northern Samar, and Eastern Samar; the northern seaboard of Camarines Sur.
• Mariners of motorbancas and similarly-sized vessels are advised to take precautionary measures while venturing out to sea and, if possible, avoid navigation under these conditions.
TRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK
• MARCE is forecast to move west northwestward to northwestward until Wednesday (6 November) morning before it begins to decelerate significantly while turning westward. From Wednesday afternoon until the end of the forecast period, this tropical cyclone will move north northwestward to westward at a slow pace over the Philippine Sea east of Extreme Northern Luzon. This portion of the forecast has a high uncertainty due to two possible scenarios – either (1) the tropical cyclone will move more westward towards Extreme Northern Luzon or mainland Luzon or (2) the tropical cyclone will move erratically over the Philippine Sea east of Extreme Northern Luzon. As such, this portion of the track forecast is highly likely to change in the succeeding advisories or bulletins.
• A westward shift in track is likely within the next 24 hours due to the high-pressure area north of MARCE. As such, the landfall scenario may change from Babuyan Islands down to Isabela area.
• This tropical cyclone is expected to gradually intensify and may reach severe tropical storm category by tomorrow (5 November) morning or afternoon. Furthermore, it may also reach typhoon category by tomorrow evening or Wednesday early morning. Rapid intensification is likely.
Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. For heavy rainfall warnings, thunderstorm/rainfall advisories, and other severe weather information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your local PAGASA Regional Services Division.
The next tropical cyclone bulletin will be issued at 11:00 AM today.

OTHER HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND AREAS
Heavy Rainfall Outlook
Refer to Weather Advisory No. 22 issued at 5:00 AM today for the Heavy Rainfall Outlook associated with MARCE.(tinyurl.com/wx-adv)
Severe Winds
The wind signals warn the public of the general wind threat over an area due to the tropical cyclone. Local winds may be slightly stronger/enhanced in coastal and upland/mountainous areas exposed to winds. Winds are less strong in areas sheltered from the prevailing wind direction.
• Significant to severe impacts from typhoon-force winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 4.
• Moderate to significant impacts from gale-force winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 3.
• Minor to moderate impacts from gale-force winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 2.
• Minimal to minor impacts from strong winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 1.
Furthermore, the northeasterly wind flow and the periphery of MARCE will also bring strong to gale-force gusts over the following areas (especially in coastal and upland areas exposed to winds):
• Today (8 November): Batanes, Cagayan including Babuyan Islands, Isabela, and Ilocos Region.
• Tomorrow (9 November): Batanes and Babuyan Islands
Coastal Inundation 
There is a high risk of life-threatening storm surge with peak surge heights exceeding 3.0 m in the next 48 hours over the low-lying or exposed coastal localities of Batanes, Cagayan including Babuyan Islands, Isabela, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, and La Union. Refer to Storm Surge Warning No. 11 issued at 2:00 AM today for the details.
HAZARDS AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS
A Gale Warning is hoisted over the seaboards of Northern Luzon. For more information, refer to Gale Warning No. 9 issued at 5:00 AM today. (tinyurl.com/wx-gale)
24-Hour Sea Condition Outlook
Up to very rough, high, or very high seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 12.0 m: The seaboard of Babuyan Islands and Ilocos Norte
• Up to 8.0 m: The seaboard of Ilocos Sur
• Up to 6.0 m: The remaining seaboard of Ilocos Region; the western seaboard of Batanes
• Up to 5.0 m: The northern seaboard of mainland Cagayan; the remaining seaboard of Batanes 
• Up to 4.5 m: The western seaboard of Pangasinan; the remaining seaboard of mainland Cagayan.
Sea travel is risky for all types or tonnage of vessels. All mariners must remain in port or, if underway, seek shelter or safe harbor as soon as possible until winds and waves subside. 
Up to rough seas over the following coastal waters: 
• Up to 3.5 m: The seaboard of Kalayaan Islands, Zambales, and Isabela
• Up to 3.0 m: The northeastern seaboard of Aurora; the western seaboard of Bataan, Lubang Islands, Calamian islands and mainland Palawan
Mariners of small seacrafts, including all types of motorbancas, are advised not to venture out to sea under these conditions, especially if inexperienced or operating ill-equipped vessels.
Up to moderate seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 2.5 m: The northern and eastern seaboards of Polillo Islands and Catanduanes; the northern seaboard of Camarines Norte and Camarines Sur; the northern and eastern seaboards of Northern Samar; the eastern seaboards of Albay, Sorsogon, and Eastern Samar; the western seaboard of Bataan; the remaining seaboard of Aurora
• Up to 2.0 m: The seaboards of Quezon; the western seaboards of Occidental Mindoro and Batangas; the eastern seaboards of Camarines Sur, Dinagat Islands, and Surigao del Sur
Mariners of motorbancas and similarly-sized vessels are advised to take precautionary measures while venturing out to sea and, if possible, avoid navigation under these conditions.
TRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK
• In the forecast track, MARCE will continue moving generally westward and exit the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) region this afternoon or evening. The surge of the northeasterly wind flow will result in a generally southwestward movement beginning on Sunday (10 November).
• MARCE is forecast to continue to weaken for the next days due to the possible dry air intrusion from the prevailing northeasterly wind flow. Nevertheless, it will remain as a typhoon throughout its passage within the PAR region. 
Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all 4necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. For heavy rainfall warnings, thunderstorm/rainfall advisories, and other severe weather information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your local PAGASA Regional Services Division.

The next tropical cyclone bulletin will be issued at 8:00 AM today.

There is a high risk of life-threatening storm surge with peak heights exceeding 3.0 m in the next 48 hours over the low-lying or exposed coastal localities of Batanes, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Cagayan including Babuyan Islands, Isabela, and northern Aurora. Refer to Storm Surge Warning No. 10 issued at 8:00 PM today for the details.
HAZARDS AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS
A Gale Warning is hoisted over the northern and eastern seaboards of Northern Luzon and the eastern seaboard of Central Luzon. Refer to Gale Warning No. 4 issued at 5:00 PM today for more details.
24-Hour Sea Condition Outlook
Up to very rough or high seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 10.0 m: The seaboard of Cagayan including Babuyan Islands
• Up to 7.0 m:  The seaboard of Batanes  and the northern seaboard of Ilocos Norte
• Sea travel is risky for all types or tonnage of vessels. All mariners must remain in port or, if underway, seek shelter or safe harbor as soon as possible until winds and waves subside. 
Up to rough seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 4.0 m: The seaboard of Isabela and the northern seaboard of Aurora
• Up to 3.0 m: The remaining seaboard of Aurora and Ilocos Norte, the seaboard of northern mainland Quezon, the northern and eastern seaboard of Polillo Islands.
• Mariners of small seacrafts, including all types of motorbancas, are advised not to venture out to sea under these conditions, especially if inexperienced or operating ill-equipped vessels.
Up to moderate seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 2.5 m: The seaboard of Camarines Norte and Ilocos Sur, the northern seaboard of Camarines Sur; the northern and eastern seaboards of Catanduanes
• Up to 2.0 m: The eastern seaboard of mainland Quezon, Camarines Sur, Albay, Sorsogon, and Eastern Samar; the remaining seaboard of Catanduanes; the northern and eastern seaboards of Northern Samar.
• Mariners of motorbancas and similarly-sized vessels are advised to take precautionary measures while venturing out to sea and, if possible, avoid navigation under these conditions.
TRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK
• OFEL will continue moving northwestward and pass close or make landfall in the vicinity of Babuyan Islands tonight before turning northward tomorrow (15 November) over the sea west of Batanes, then northeastward towards Taiwan during the weekend. Note that hazards on land and coastal waters may still be experienced in areas outside the landfall point and the forecast confidence cone. Furthermore, the track may still shift within the limit of the forecast confidence cone. 
• OFEL is forecast to continue to weaken throughout the forecast period due to frictional effects of land, as well as the increasingly unfavorable environment over the Luzon Strait and the sea east of Taiwan. 
Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. For heavy rainfall warnings, thunderstorm/rainfall advisories, and other severe weather information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your local PAGASA Regional Services Division.
The next tropical cyclone bulletin will be issued at 8:00 PM today.

"TROPICAL CYCLONE ADVISORY NR. 1
Tropical Storm “BEBINCA”
Issued at 11:00 PM, 10 September 2024
Valid for broadcast until the next bulletin at 11:00 AM tomorrow.

TROPICAL DEPRESSION OUTSIDE THE PHILIPPINE AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY INTENSIFIES INTO TROPICAL STORM “BEBINCA” WHILE PASSING CLOSE TO GUAM

Location of Center (10:00 PM):
The center of Tropical Storm BEBINCA was estimated based on all available at 2,105 km East of Eastern Visayas (12.7°N, 145.0°E) 

Intensity:
Maximum sustained winds of 65 km/h near the center, gustiness of up to 80 km/h, and central pressure of 998 hPa 

Present Movement:
Northeastward at 20 km/h 

Extent of Tropical Cyclone Winds 
Strong to storm-force winds extend outwards up to 200 km from the center 

GENERAL OUTLOOK FOR THE FORECAST PERIOD
• BEBINCA is forecast to track generally northwestward tonight through Friday evening (13 September). A turn to the west northwest while accelerating is possible by Friday evening onwards as BEBINCA approaches the northeastern boundary of the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR). BEBINCA is expected to enter PAR by Friday evening and exit PAR by Saturday (14 September).
• BEBINCA is forecast to intensify into severe tropical storm by Friday morning. The possibility of intensifying into a typhoon category is not ruled out, considering that the weather disturbance is still over the Pacific Ocean.
• Current track scenario shows that BEBINCA will not directly affect any part of the country throughout the forecast period. However, it is expected to enhance the Southwest Monsoon which will bring occasional rains over Visayas and Palawan, while scattered rainshowers and thunderstorms over Bicol Region, the rest of MIMAROPA, and Mindanao starting on Thursday (12 September) onwards. However, the occasional rains scenario may still change depending on track and intensity of BEBINCA.

Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to continue monitoring for updates related to this tropical cyclone. 

Unless there is an intermediate issuance, the next tropical cyclone advisory will be issued at 11:00 AM tomorrow.

"DOST-PHIVOLCS Tsunami Scenario 

Sa ginawang tsunami simulation, hinati ang Manila Trench sa apat na segments. Ang mga sequence ng offshore earthquakes sa Santa Catalina, Ilocos Sur ay nangyayari sa Manila Trench segment 2 (MT2). 

Base sa model, ang worst case scenario kung sakaling gumalaw ang buong MT2 ay isang Magnitude 8.4 na lindol.

Kapag nakalikha ito ng tsunami, ang unang alon ay makakarating sa baybayin ng mga probinsya ng Zambales, Pangasinan, La Union, Ilocos Sur, Ilocos Norte at Cagayan sa loob ng dalawa (2) hanggang 15 minuto. Samantala, ang taas ng alon ay maaaring umabot ng tatlo (3) hanggang 15 metro. 

Makikita sa table ang mga calculation point base sa pag-aaral ng DOST-PHIVOLCS gamit ang mga available na scientific at technical na impormasyon. Maaaring gamitin ito bilang gabay sa paghahanda ng pamahalaan at komunidad.

Tandaan, HINDI KAYANG MA-PREDICT KUNG KAILAN MANGYAYARI ANG LINDOL AT TSUNAMI.

Maging mapagmatiyag sa mga SENYALES NG LOKAL NA TSUNAMI:
1. Malakas na lindol (Shake)
2. Biglaang pagbabago sa antas ng tubig-dagat (Drop)
3. Kakaibang tunog mula sa dagat (Roar).

Kapag nakaranas ng kahit isa sa mga senyales na ito, AGARANG LUMIKAS SA MATAAS NA LUGAR O PAPALAYO SA DAGAT.

Ang tamang kaalaman at kahandaan ay susi sa kaligtasan.

OTHER HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND AREAS
Heavy Rainfall Outlook
Refer to Weather Advisory No. 23 issued at 11:00 AM today for the heavy rainfall outlook due to “OFEL”.
Severe Winds
The wind signals warn the public of the general wind threat over an area due to the tropical cyclone. Local winds may be slightly stronger/enhanced in coastal and upland/mountainous areas exposed to winds. Winds are less strong in areas sheltered from the prevailing wind direction.
• Minimal to minor impacts from strong winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 1.
The highest Wind Signal which may be hoisted during the occurrence of OFEL is Wind Signal No. 4.
Coastal Inundation
There is a moderate to high risk of life-threatening storm surge reaching 1.0 to 3.0 m in the next 48 hours over the low-lying or exposed coastal localities of Batanes, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Cagayan including Babuyan Islands, Isabela, and northern Aurora. Refer to Storm Surge Warning No. 4 issued at 8:00 AM today for the details.
HAZARDS AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS
24-Hour Sea Condition Outlook
Up to very rough or high seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 10.0 m: The eastern seaboard of mainland Cagayan.
• Up to 8.0 m: The seaboards of Isabela and northern Aurora
• Up to 7.0 m: The seaboard of Babuyan Islands and the remaining seaboard of mainland Cagayan
• Up to 6.0 m: The seaboard of northern Aurora 
• Sea travel is risky for all types or tonnage of vessels. All mariners must remain in port or, if underway, seek shelter or safe harbor as soon as possible until winds and waves subside. 
Up to rough seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 4.0 m: The seaboard of Batanes 
• Up to 3.5 m: The northern and eastern seaboards of Catanduanes and Polillo Islands; the remaining seaboard of Aurora; the seaboard of Camarines Norte and northern Quezon; the northern seaboard of Camarines Sur.
• Mariners of small seacrafts, including all types of motorbancas, are advised not to venture out to sea under these conditions, especially if inexperienced or operating ill-equipped vessels.
Up to moderate seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 2.5 m: The northern seaboard of Ilocos Norte; the eastern seaboard of mainland Quezon including the rest of Polillo Islands, Albay, and Sorsogon; northern and eastern seaboards of Northern Samar
• Up to 2.0 m: The remaining seaboard of Ilocos Region; the seaboard of Kalayaan Islands; the eastern seaboard of Camarines Sur and Eastern Samar; the remaining seaboard of Catanduanes.
• Mariners of motorbancas and similarly-sized vessels are advised to take precautionary measures while venturing out to sea and, if possible, avoid navigation under these conditions.
TRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK
• OFEL is forecast to move west northwestward to northwestward over the Philippine Sea before making landfall along the eastern coast of Cagayan or Isabela tomorrow (14 November) afternoon. It will then emerge over the Luzon Strait on Friday (15 November) and turn more north northwestward while slowing down before behaving erratically during the weekend. Regardless of the position of the landfall point, it must be emphasized that hazards on land and coastal waters may still be experienced in areas outside the landfall point or forecast confidence cone. 
• It must also be emphasized that the track may still shift within the limit of the forecast confidence cone, especially on the 4th and 5th day of the forecast track. In particular, two scenarios are emerging: a northwestward track until Friday before turning west southwestward during the weekend, and a slightly recurving track to the right of the present track forecast. Given these, further changes in the track forecast are expected.
• OFEL is forecast to steadily intensify within 24 hours and possibly make landfall during its peak intensity.
Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. For heavy rainfall warnings, thunderstorm/rainfall advisories, and other severe weather information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your local PAGASA Regional Services Division.
The next tropical cyclone bulletin will be issued at 5:00 PM today.

Tropical Depression 
Issued at 5:00 PM, 03 November 2024
Valid for broadcast until the next bulletin at 11:00 PM today.

THE LOW PRESSURE AREA OUTSIDE THE PHILIPPINE AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY DEVELOPED INTO A TROPICAL DEPRESSION

Location of Center (4:00 PM):
The center of Tropical Depression was estimated based on all available at 1,315 km East of Eastern Visayas (OUTSIDE PAR) (9.8°N, 137.7°E)

Intensity: 
Maximum sustained winds of 55 km/h near the center, gustiness of up to 70 km/h, and central pressure of 1004 hPa

Present Movement:
Northwestward at 30 km/h

Extent of Tropical Cyclone Winds 
Strong winds extend outwards up to 340 km from the center 

GENERAL OUTLOOK FOR THE FORECAST PERIOD
• The Tropical Depression will steadily move northwestward at a fast pace and may enter the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) tomorrow (4 November) as Tropical Cyclone MARCE. This northwestward movement will continue until Tuesday (5 November), before it begins to slow down significantly while turning more northward. 
• From Wednesday until the end of the forecast period, the tropical cyclone will move northward, then westward at a slow pace over the Philippine east of Extreme Northern Luzon. This portion of the forecast has a high uncertainty due to two possible scenarios – either (1) the tropical cyclone will move more westward towards Extreme Northern Luzon or mainland Luzon or (2) the tropical cyclone will move erratically over the Philippine Sea east of Extreme Northern Luzon. As such this portion of the track forecast is highly likely to change in the succeeding advisories or bulletins.
• As the tropical depressions moves northwestward within the PAR region, it may enhance the surge of northeasterly wind flow which may occur within the week. This, and the trough of the tropical cyclone, will bring rains over Extreme Northern Luzon and the eastern section of Luzon beginning tomorrow or on Tuesday. Should the forecast track of this tropical cyclone change to a more landfalling scenario, heavy to torrential rainfall caused directly by the tropical cyclone may begin affecting Northern Luzon on Thursday (7 November) or Friday (8 November). Flooding and rain-induced landslides are possible under these conditions, especially in susceptible areas identified in hazard maps and in areas with significant rainfall observed over the past several days (due to saturated soil condition).
• Although a northeasterly windflow is already bringing moderate to rough seas over the seaboards of Northern Luzon, the approaching tropical cyclone will worsen sea condition this week (due to the enhancement of the northeasterly windflow) over the seaboards of Northern Luzon and the western and eastern seaboards of Central and Southern Luzon. Furthermore, the hoisting of Gale Warning over the seaboards of Northern Luzon may begin on Tuesday.

OTHER HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND AREAS
○ Heavy Rainfall Outlook
Refer to Weather Advisory No. 20 issued at 11:00 PM today for the Heavy Rainfall Outlook associated with MARCE.
○ Severe Winds
The wind signals warn the public of the general wind threat over an area due to the tropical cyclone. Local winds may be slightly stronger/enhanced in coastal and upland/mountainous areas exposed to winds. Winds are less strong in areas sheltered from the prevailing wind direction.
• Significant to severe impacts from typhoon-force winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 4.
• Moderate to significant impacts from gale-force winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 3.
• Minor to moderate impacts from gale-force winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 2.
• Minimal to minor impacts from strong winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 1.
Furthermore, the northeasterly wind flow and the periphery of MARCE will also bring strong to gale-force gusts over the following areas (especially in coastal and upland areas exposed to winds):
• Tomorrow (8 November): Batanes, Cagayan including Babuyan Islands, Isabela, and Ilocos Region.
• Saturday (9 November): Batanes and Babuyan Islands
○ Coastal Inundation 
There is a high risk of life-threatening storm surge with peak surge heights exceeding 3.0 m in the next 48 hours over the low-lying or exposed coastal localities of Batanes, Cagayan including Babuyan Islands, Isabela, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, and La Union. Refer to Storm Surge Warning No. 10 issued at 8:00 PM today for the details.
HAZARDS AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS
A Gale Warning is hoisted over the seaboards of Northern Luzon and the western seaboard of Central Luzon. For more information, refer to Gale Warning No. 8 issued at 5:00 PM today.
○ 24-Hour Sea Condition Outlook
Up to very rough, high, or very high seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 12.0 m: The seaboard of Babuyan Islands and Ilocos Norte; the northern seaboard of mainland Cagayan.
• Up to 7.0 m: The remaining seaboard of Cagayan.
• Up to 7.0 m: The seaboards of Batanes and Ilocos Sur.
• Up to 5.0 m: The remaining seaboard of Ilocos Region; 
• Up to 4.5 m: The seaboards of northern Zambales and Isabela.
Sea travel is risky for all types or tonnage of vessels. All mariners must remain in port or, if underway, seek shelter or safe harbor as soon as possible until winds and waves subside. 
Up to rough seas over the following coastal waters: 
• Up to 4.0 m: The seaboard of Kalayaan Islands
• Up to 3.5 m: The seaboards of Zambales.
• Up to 3.0 m: The northern and eastern seaboards of Polillo Islands and Catanduanes; the northern seaboard of Camarines Sur; the western seaboard of Bataan, Lubang Islands, Calamian islands and mainland Palawan
Mariners of small seacrafts, including all types of motorbancas, are advised not to venture out to sea under these conditions, especially if inexperienced or operating ill-equipped vessels.
Up to moderate seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 2.5 m: The northern and eastern seaboards of Polillo Islands; the northern and eastern seaboards of Northern Samar; the eastern seaboards of Albay, Sorsogon, and Eastern Samar; the remaining seaboard of Aurora
• Up to 2.0 m: The seaboards of Quezon; the western seaboards of Occidental Mindoro and Batangas; the eastern seaboards of Camarines Sur, Dinagat Islands, and Surigao del Sur
Mariners of motorbancas and similarly-sized vessels are advised to take precautionary measures while venturing out to sea and, if possible, avoid navigation under these conditions.
TRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK
• In the forecast track, MARCE will move westward over Cagayan-Apayao-Ilocos Norte area tonight and emerge over the waters west of Ilocos Norte tomorrow (8 November) early morning.
• Regardless of the position of the center of the eye in the next several hours, it must be emphasized that potentially life threatening conditions due to typhoon-force winds, storm surge inundation, and torrential rainfall will be experienced in the Babuyan Islands and the northern portions of mainland Cagayan, Ilocos Norte, and Apayao
• After crossing the northern portion of Northern Luzon, MARCE will continue moving generally westward and exit the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) region tomorrow afternoon or evening. The surge of the northeasterly wind flow will result in a generally southwestward movement beginning on Sunday (10 November).
• The possibility of reaching Super Typhoon category is still not ruled out. Weakening may begin within the next 12 to 24 hours due to interaction with the terrain of mainland Luzon and the possible dry air intrusion from the prevailing northeasterly wind flow. Nevertheless, it will remain as a typhoon throughout its passage within the PAR region. 
Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all 4necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. For heavy rainfall warnings, thunderstorm/rainfall advisories, and other severe weather information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your local PAGASA Regional Services Division.

The next tropical cyclone bulletin will be issued at 2:00 AM tomorrow.

OTHER HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND AREAS
Heavy Rainfall Outlook
Refer to Weather Advisory No. 19 issued at 8:00 PM today for the Heavy Rainfall Outlook associated with MARCE.
Severe Winds
The wind signals warn the public of the general wind threat over an area due to the tropical cyclone. Local winds may be slightly stronger/enhanced in coastal and upland/mountainous areas exposed to winds. Winds are less strong in areas sheltered from the prevailing wind direction.
• Significant to severe impacts from typhoon-force winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 4.
• Moderate to significant impacts from gale-force winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 3.
• Minor to moderate impacts from gale-force winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 2.
• Minimal to minor impacts from strong winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 1.
Furthermore, the northeasterly wind flow and the periphery of MARCE will also bring strong to gale-force gusts over the following areas (especially in coastal and upland areas exposed to winds):
• Today (7 November): Zambales, Bataan, and Polillo Islands
• Tomorrow (8 November): Batanes, Cagayan including Babuyan Islands, Isabela, and Ilocos Region.
• Saturday (9 November): Batanes and Babuyan Islands
Coastal Inundation 
There is a high risk of life-threatening storm surge with peak surge heights exceeding 3.0 m in the next 48 hours over the low-lying or exposed coastal localities of Batanes, Cagayan including Babuyan Islands, Isabela, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, and La Union. Refer to Storm Surge Warning No. 10 issued at 8:00 PM today for the details.
HAZARDS AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS
A Gale Warning is hoisted over the seaboards of Northern Luzon and the western seaboard of Central Luzon. For more information, refer to Gale Warning No. 8 issued at 5:00 PM today.
24-Hour Sea Condition Outlook
Up to very rough, high, or very high seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 12.0 m: The seaboard of Babuyan Islands and Ilocos Norte; the northern seaboard of mainland Cagayan.
• Up to 8.0 m: The remaining seaboard of Cagayan.
• Up to 7.0 m: The seaboards of Batanes and Ilocos Sur.
• Up to 5.0 m: The remaining seaboard of Ilocos Region; 
• Up to 4.5 m: The seaboards of northern Zambales and Isabela.
Sea travel is risky for all types or tonnage of vessels. All mariners must remain in port or, if underway, seek shelter or safe harbor as soon as possible until winds and waves subside. 
Up to rough seas over the following coastal waters: 
• Up to 4.0 m: The seaboard of Kalayaan Islands
• Up to 3.5 m: The seaboards of Camarines Norte and northern Aurora, the remaining seaboard of Zambales.
• Up to 3.0 m: The northern and eastern seaboards of Polillo Islands and Catanduanes; the northern seaboard of Camarines Sur; the western seaboard of Bataan, Lubang Islands, Calamian islands and mainland Palawan
Mariners of small seacrafts, including all types of motorbancas, are advised not to venture out to sea under these conditions, especially if inexperienced or operating ill-equipped vessels.
Up to moderate seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 2.5 m: The northern and eastern seaboards of Northern Samar; the eastern seaboards of Albay, Sorsogon, and Eastern Samar; the remaining seaboard of Aurora; the seaboard of northern Quezon.
• Up to 2.0 m: The western seaboards of Occidental Mindoro and Batangas; the eastern seaboards of Camarines Sur, Dinagat Islands, and Surigao del Sur
Mariners of motorbancas and similarly-sized vessels are advised to take precautionary measures while venturing out to sea and, if possible, avoid navigation under these conditions.
TRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK
• Typhoon MARCE will move generally westward, emerge over Aparri Bay, and possibly make another landfall along the coast of northwestern mainland Cagayan tonight. MARCE will emerge over the West Philippines tomorrow (8 November) early morning.
• Regardless of the position of the center of the eye in the next several hours, it must be emphasized that potentially life threatening conditions due to typhoon-force winds, storm surge inundation, and torrential rainfall will be experienced in the Babuyan Islands and the northern portions of mainland Cagayan, Ilocos Norte, and Apayao
• After crossing the northern portion of Northern Luzon, MARCE will continue moving generally westward and exit the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) region tomorrow afternoon or evening. The surge of the northeasterly wind flow will result in a generally southwestward movement beginning on Sunday (10 November).
• The possibility of reaching Super Typhoon category after crossing northeastern Cagayan is still not ruled out. Weakening may begin within the next 12 to 24 hours due to interaction with the terrain of mainland Luzon and the possible dry air intrusion from the prevailing northeasterly wind flow. Nevertheless, it will remain as a typhoon throughout its passage within the PAR region. 
Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all 4necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. For heavy rainfall warnings, thunderstorm/rainfall advisories, and other severe weather information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your local PAGASA Regional Services Division.
The next tropical cyclone bulletin will be issued at 11:00 PM today.

(𝟮𝟱 𝗢𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗯𝗲𝗿) Severe Tropical Storm KRISTINE will exit the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) and bring gusty winds over Ilocos Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, Zambales, Bataan. A southwesterly wind flow triggered by KRISTINE and Tropical Depression KONG-REY outside the PAR will bring mostly cloudy skies with scattered rain showers and thunderstorms over Palawan, Western Visayas, Negros Island Region, Zamboanga Peninsula, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi. The rest of the country will have partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rain showers or thunderstorms.

(𝟮𝟲 𝘁𝗼 𝟮𝟳 𝗢𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗯𝗲𝗿), the southwesterly wind flow will continue bringing mostly cloudy skies with scattered rain showers and thunderstorms over Palawan, Western Visayas, Negros Island Region, Zamboanga Peninsula, while the rest of the country will have partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rain showers or thunderstorms. Tropical Cyclone KONG-REY may also enter the PAR region, but is less likely to directly affect the country during this period. Once inside PAR, KONG-REY will be named locally as LEON.

(𝟮𝟴 𝘁𝗼 𝟮𝟵 𝗢𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗯𝗲𝗿), LEON will continue moving westward or west northwestward over the Philippine Sea while gradually slowing down. Its outer rainbands will bring mostly cloudy skies with scattered rain showers and thunderstorms over Batanes and Cagayan including Babuyan Islands. During the same period, Tropical Cyclone KRISTINE is forecast to be on its eastward movement towards the PAR region after looping over the West Philippine Sea. The trough of KRISTINE and the weakening southwesterly wind flow will bring mostly cloudy skies with scattered rain showers and thunderstorms over Palawan, Western Visayas, and Negros Island Region. The rest of the country will have partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rain showers or thunderstorms, although the chance of rainshowers or thunderstorms is higher along the eastern section of Luzon.

(𝟯𝟬 𝘁𝗼 𝟯𝟭 𝗢𝗰𝘁𝗼𝗯𝗲𝗿), LEON will recurve generally northward and remain offshore of the Philippine landmass. Batanes and Cagayan including Babuyan Islands may still have mostly cloudy skies with scattered rain showers and thunderstorms due to the rainbands of LEON (especially on Wednesday). With KRISTINE continuing its generally eastward motion towards the PAR region, a re-entry scenario during this period is not ruled out. Nevertheless, the trough of KRISTINE will bring mostly cloudy skies with scattered rain showers and thunderstorms over Ilocos Region, Abra, Benguet, Zambales, Bataan, Occidental Mindoro, Palawan, and Western Visayas. The rest of the country will have partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rain showers or thunderstorms.

(𝟭 𝗡𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿), the trough of KRISTINE may bring mostly cloudy skies over most of Southern Luzon and Visayas. The rest of the country will have partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rain showers or thunderstorms, with higher chance of thunderstorms over the eastern section of Northern and Central Luzon due to Easterlies and over Mindanao due to the trough of KRISTINE.

• Minor to moderate impacts from gale-force winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 2.
• Minimal to minor impacts from strong winds are possible within any of the areas under Wind Signal No. 1.
Coastal Inundation
There is a high risk of life-threatening storm surge with peak heights exceeding 3.0 m in the next 48 hours over the low-lying or exposed coastal localities of Batanes, Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Cagayan including Babuyan Islands, Isabela, and northern Aurora. Refer to Storm Surge Warning No. 9 issued at 2:00 PM today for the details.
HAZARDS AFFECTING COASTAL WATERS
A Gale Warning is hoisted over the northern and eastern seaboards of Northern Luzon and the eastern seaboard of Central Luzon. Refer to Gale Warning No. 4 issued at 5:00 PM today for more details.
24-Hour Sea Condition Outlook
Up to very rough or high seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 12.0 m: The seaboard of Cagayan including Babuyan Islands
• Up to 8.0 m: The seaboards of Isabela and Batanes
• Up to 6.0 m: The northern seaboard of Ilocos Norte
• Sea travel is risky for all types or tonnage of vessels. All mariners must remain in port or, if underway, seek shelter or safe harbor as soon as possible until winds and waves subside. 
Up to rough seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 4.0 m: The seaboard of northern Aurora
• Up to 3.0 m: The remaining seaboard of Aurora and Ilocos Norte, the seaboard of northern mainland Quezon, the northern and eastern seaboard of Polillo Islands.
• Mariners of small seacrafts, including all types of motorbancas, are advised not to venture out to sea under these conditions, especially if inexperienced or operating ill-equipped vessels.
Up to moderate seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 2.5 m: The seaboard of Camarines Norte and Ilocos Sur, the northern seaboard of Camarines Sur; the northern and eastern seaboards of Catanduanes
• Up to 2.0 m: The eastern seaboard of mainland Quezon, Camarines Sur, Albay, Sorsogon, and Eastern Samar; the remaining seaboard of Catanduanes; the northern and eastern seaboards of Northern Samar.
• Mariners of motorbancas and similarly-sized vessels are advised to take precautionary measures while venturing out to sea and, if possible, avoid navigation under these conditions.
TRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK
• OFEL will continue crossing the northeastern portion of mainland Luzon this afternoon. It will then continue moving northwestward and pass close or make landfall in the vicinity of Babuyan Islands tonight before turning northward tomorrow (15 November) over the sea west of Batanes, then northeastward over the sea east of Taiwan during the weekend. Note that hazards on land and coastal waters may still be experienced in areas outside the landfall point and the forecast confidence cone. Furthermore, the track may still shift within the limit of the forecast confidence cone. 
• OFEL has started to weaken due to increasing interaction with the landmass of Luzon. It will continue to weaken throughout the forecast period due to frictional effects of land, as well as the increasingly unfavorable environment over the Luzon Strait and the sea east of Taiwan. 
Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. For heavy rainfall warnings, thunderstorm/rainfall advisories, and other severe weather information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your local PAGASA Regional Services Division.
The next tropical cyclone bulletin will be issued at 8:00 PM today.

• Up to 4.5 m: The seaboards of Kalayaan Islands
• Up to 3.5 m: The northern and eastern seaboards of Polillo Islands; the seaboards of Camarines Norte; the northern seaboards of Catanduanes and Camarines Sur; the remaining seaboard of Zambales.
• Up to 3.0 m: The eastern seaboard of Catanduanes; the seaboard of northern Quezon.
Mariners of small seacrafts, including all types of motorbancas, are advised not to venture out to sea under these conditions, especially if inexperienced or operating ill-equipped vessels.
Up to moderate seas over the following coastal waters:
• Up to 2.5 m: The northern and eastern seaboards of Northern Samar; the eastern seaboards of Albay, Sorsogon, and Eastern Samar; the western seaboards of Bataan, Lubang Islands, Palawan including Calamian Islands;
• Up to 2.0 m: The western seaboards of Occidental Mindoro; the eastern seaboard of Camarines Sur and Dinagat Islands
Mariners of motorbancas and similarly-sized vessels are advised to take precautionary measures while venturing out to sea and, if possible, avoid navigation under these conditions.

TRACK AND INTENSITY OUTLOOK
• MARCE is forecast to move generally west northwestward tonight until tomorrow (7 November) morning over the waters east of Cagayan before gradually accelerating westward tomorrow afternoon through Saturday (9 November) over the Babuyan Channel and the northern portion of the West Philippine Sea. On the forecast track, MARCE will make landfall and traverse Babuyan Islands and/or the northern portions of mainland Cagayan, Ilocos Norte, and Apayao (or pass very close to these areas) from tomorrow afternoon to Friday (8 November) early morning. MARCE may exit the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) region on Friday evening. The surge of the northeasterly wind flow will result a more southwestward movement during the weekend.
• MARCE may have reached its peak intensity. Slight weakening is expected due to possible interaction with the terrain of mainland Luzon during the landfall or close approach of MARCE, although it will remain as a typhoon throughout its passage within the PAR region. The surge of the northeasterly wind flow will trigger a continuous period of weakening during the weekend.

Considering these developments, the public and disaster risk reduction and management offices concerned are advised to take all necessary measures to protect life and property. Persons living in areas identified to be highly or very highly susceptible to these hazards are advised to follow evacuation and other instructions from local officials. For heavy rainfall warnings, thunderstorm/rainfall advisories, and other severe weather information specific to your area, please monitor products issued by your local PAGASA Regional Services Division.

The next tropical cyclone bulletin will be issued at 2:00 AM tomorrow.
